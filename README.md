<details><summary><b>Styled Components</b></summary>
<p>

- `ThemeProvider`: A helper component for theming. Injects the theme into all styled components anywhere beneath it in the component tree. https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#themeprovider
- `theme`: An object that will be injected as `theme` into all interpolations in styled components beneath the provider
- createGlobalStyle: A helper function to generate a special `StyledComponent` that handles global styles. Normally, styled components are automatically scoped to a local CSS class and therefore isolated from other components. In the case of `createGlobalStyle`, this limitation is removed and things like CSS resets or base stylesheets can be applied. https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#createglobalstyle

- `<Route>`: Route matching is done by comparing a <Route>'s path prop to the current locationâ€™s pathname. When a <Route> matches it will render its content and when it does not match, it will render null. A <Route> with no path will always match.
- `<Switch>`: The <Switch> component is used to group <Route>s together. The <Switch> is not required for grouping <Route>s, but it can be quite useful.
- Route Component: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route
  - component: A React component to render only when the location matches. It will be rendered with route props. https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/component
  - exact(bool): When true, will only match if the path matches the location.pathname exactly. https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/exact-bool
